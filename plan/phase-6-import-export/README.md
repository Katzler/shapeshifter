# Phase 6: Import/Export

Add data portability features - export to JSON file and import from file.

## Tasks

1. [Export to JSON File](./01-export.md)
2. [Import from JSON File](./02-import.md)
3. [Data Actions UI](./03-actions-ui.md)

## Phase Outcome

Users can export all data to a JSON file for backup. They can import a JSON file to restore or transfer data. Clear UI for these actions.
