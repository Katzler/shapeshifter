# Phase 4: Preference Grid

Build the main editing interface - a grid where users set preferences for each day/shift combination.

## Tasks

1. [Grid Layout](./01-grid-layout.md)
2. [Preference Cell](./02-preference-cell.md)
3. [Grid Integration](./03-grid-integration.md)

## Phase Outcome

Selecting an agent shows their editable preference grid. Clicking cells cycles through states. Changes persist immediately.
