# Grid Layout

## Context

Create the grid structure with days as columns and shifts as rows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Grid displays when an agent is selected
- [ ] Show "Select an agent" placeholder when no agent selected
- [ ] Column headers: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun
- [ ] Row headers: Show shift time ranges (e.g., "00:00-07:00")
- [ ] Grid cells are uniform size and aligned
- [ ] Selected agent's name displayed above the grid
- [ ] Grid is readable without horizontal scrolling on typical desktop screens

## Out of Scope

- Responsive/collapsible grid for mobile
- Customizable column/row order
- Hiding specific days or shifts

## Notes

Consider using CSS Grid for the layout. Keep header styling distinct from data cells.
