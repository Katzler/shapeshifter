# View Toggle / Tabs

## Context

Add navigation to switch between the preference editor and coverage summary views.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tab bar or toggle in the main content area header
- [ ] Two options: "Editor" (or "Preferences") and "Coverage"
- [ ] Active tab is visually distinct
- [ ] Switching tabs preserves agent selection
- [ ] Editor tab shows the preference grid (existing functionality)
- [ ] Coverage tab shows the coverage summary (built in next tasks)
- [ ] Default view is Editor

## Out of Scope

- URL routing (tabs don't change URL)
- Remembering last active tab across sessions
- More than two views

## Notes

Keep the tab UI simple - this is not a full navigation system, just a view toggle.
