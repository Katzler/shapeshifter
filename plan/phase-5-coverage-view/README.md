# Phase 5: Coverage View

Add a summary view showing aggregated preference counts across all agents.

## Tasks

1. [View Toggle / Tabs](./01-view-toggle.md)
2. [Coverage Calculation](./02-coverage-calculation.md)
3. [Coverage Grid Display](./03-coverage-display.md)

## Phase Outcome

A tab/toggle switches between "Edit" (preference grid) and "Coverage" views. Coverage shows counts of available/unavailable/neutral agents per day+shift.
